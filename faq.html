                                Yes! All our repairs come with a minimum 30-day warranty on parts and labor. For major repairs involving compressors, motors, or PCBs, we offer extended warranty options of up to 6 months. The warranty covers the same issue recurring - if the problem returns within the warranty period, we fix it free of charge.

Simple fixes may cost a few hundred rupees, while major repairs involving compressor or motor replacement can be more significant. We always provide a detailed quote before starting work - you'll know the exact cost upfront with no hidden charges. We never proceed without your approval.

For older models where original parts may be discontinued, we use high-quality compatible parts that meet or exceed original specifications. We never use cheap knockoffs that could damage your appliance or fail prematurely. All parts come with their own warranty.

                                Absolutely. Every used appliance goes through a rigorous 25-point inspection before we list it for sale. This includes checking all components, testing functionality under various conditions, and ensuring safety standards are met. Appliances that don't pass our quality standards are either refurbished or responsibly recycled - we never sell anything we wouldn't use ourselves.

                                All our used appliances come with warranty coverage ranging from 3 to 6 months, depending on the type and age of the appliance. Refrigerators and washing machines typically get 6 months, while smaller appliances get 3 months. The warranty covers any functional defects - if something goes wrong, we repair or replace it at no cost to you.

                                Customers typically save 40-60% compared to buying new. For example, a good quality used refrigerator that would cost 25,000-30,000 rupees new might be available for 12,000-15,000 from us in excellent condition with warranty. The exact savings depend on the brand, model, age, and condition of the specific appliance.

                                Yes, we require someone to be present during repairs, deliveries, and pickups. This ensures you can authorize any work, make payment, and verify everything is done to your satisfaction. You don't have to personally supervise - any responsible adult family member can be present on your behalf.
